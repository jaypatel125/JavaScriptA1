              <p>This poem addresses the important and lofty subject of "How to change the world?" As it concludes, "I took the one less travelled by, / And that has made all the difference," it immediately conveys to us that the decision one takes really does matter.</p>

              <p>The poem "<a href="image/book.jpg">The Road Not Taken</a>" makes the argument that, in the end, we are all part of the same human experience and that our uniqueness and choices may not be as important as we think. The poem considers a choice the narrator made and how it only gained significance after being told again.</p>
                  
              <p>So, if that's the case, is this poetry really not about how to change the world? No. It still revolves around this query. The most lucid and impressive section is the conclusion. Readers are left with the feeling, if nothing else, that our narrator values trying to make a difference because he can command beautiful rhyme, profound imagery, and time itself ("years and ages hence"). In this moment of reflection, the struggle is reconfigured and convoluted, but our hero and we both desire to change the world. Because of this, this poem is excellent from a simple or close reading perspective.</p>
